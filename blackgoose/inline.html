  <h2>Low and Slow</h2>
  <p>This week I am extremely excited about a new cooking technique called <i>sous vide</i>. In <i><dfn>sous vide</dfn></i> cooking, you submerge the food (usually vacuum-sealed in plastic) into a water bath that is precisely set to the target temperature you want the food to be cooked to. In his book, <cite>Coooking for Greeks</cite>, Jeff Potter describes it as <q>ultra-low-temperature poaching.</q></p>
  <p><b>Next month, we will be serving <i>Sous Vide</i> Salmon with Dill Hollandaise</b>. <em>To reserve a seat at the chef table, contact us before November 30.</em></p>
